This app is forked and diverged from a Gitpod app Simon started that can be found [here](https://github.com/redis-developer/gitpod-flask-redis).

This is the app that I've been working on during livestreams up to 8/16/22. I haven't actually highlighted it on stream - but this app can run using Gitpod, which means you don't need to install everything on your machine, you can just follow the instructions below and start adding your own features to it!

The below instructions were kindly borrowed from the original repo (thanks Simon) and he provided more detailed instructions on getting up and running. If you're hoping to make your own app using Gitpod, Flask, and Redis, you should definitely check out his app as it will be easier to make changes to.

### Using Gitpod

When using Gitpod, the only things you need are:

* A modern browser (we have tested with [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)).
* A [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

Click the button below to start a new cloud development environment using Gitpod:

If you're using Gitpod for the first time, you'll need to authorize it to work with your GitHub account.

Gitpod will then open a workspace in the browser for you.  This contains:

* VS Code for editing the code.
* An embedded browser window with the application running in it.
* Two terminal sessions: the left hand terminal can be used for entering commands, the right hand one starts the application for you.  Flask monitors for changes in the application code and will restarts the application for you whenever you save code changes in VS Code.
